                                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The proposed support to S & T Community Based Farm (STCBF) on enhanced cacao and coffee in district II of ZDS shall be implemented by the DOST-IX through the Provincial Science and Technology Center in Zamboanga del Sur and shall be funded by the DOST-IX local Grant-in-Aid Fund. The project shall intervene through S&T on the proper identification of ideal site for cacao farming via scientific assessment of new sites considering some important environmental factors as well as proper timing application and use of recommended pesticides. Production and asexual propagation of quality variety of planting materials shall be done thru establishment of cacao and coffee nurseries in every municipality under district II to sustain the supply quality variety.</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The project focuses on the potential cacao and coffee farmers in district II of ZDS. It aims to enhance the newly established cacao and coffee farms in district II through STCBF approach. The project shall also target an increase of at least 30 hectaresâ€™ cacao and coffee farm through the adoption of improved practices on cacao and coffee production and shall able to organize cacao and coffee farmers through S&T Community-Based Farm approach. It would enable to train more than 30 cacao and coffee farmers and 15 technicians on the appropriate S&T interventions for cacao production as well as to train one (1) project staff on producing varieties and planting materials and eventually, can produce and distribute at least two (2) IEC materials on cacao production.</p>
